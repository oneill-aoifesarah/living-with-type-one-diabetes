![Living with Type 1 Diabetes mockup images](assets/images/readme-images/mockup-on-devices.png)

Living with Type 1 Diabetes is a fictional website which provides information, advice, and support to Type 1 Diabetics.

It provides a clear and simple means for Type 1 Diabetics to navigate the complexities of information available in relation to the daily management of their condition and the pracitical guidance they require. The website also provides an opportunity for users to sign-up to join one of the three Peer Support Groups operating across Ireland so as to meet with other Type 1 Diabetics, share their experiences and learn from one another.

The purpose of this website is to promote the Living with Type 1 Diabetes organisation and to provide information to the users of the site including; advice on daily diabetes management; blood glucose monitoring; nutrion; and exercise. The website primarily targets an audience of newly diagnosed diabetics looking for the key points of information during their intial diagnosis, though as diabetes is a lifeling condition, the information and guidance contained in the website is required by all diabetics.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* Present key points of information in relation to the "holy trinity" of diabetes management; blood glucose monioring; nutrition & exercise; and peer support; in a clear and accesible manner.

* Provide the user with links to the organisations social media accounts and address to facilitate possible future engagement and interaction with the organisation.

* Providee the user with the opportunity to register their details online to join the organisation's network of peers. 

### User Stories

### Color Scheme and Icons
![Color scheme image](assets/images/readme-images/color-palette.png)

The colors utilised throughout are easily recogniable as the official color of diabetes campaigns (blues and pinks). This ensures that the user can easily relate to the purpose of the website upon inital review. To ensure the website remains welcoming, peaceful, and retains engamenet of the user, I utilised a pastel color scheme to ensure a calming environment for visitors to the site, complementing the pastel blues with a combination of light pinks and yellows so that the color scheme and appealability of the website was mainated. Text color complemented and added dimmension to the background color formats, with variations of white, yellow, blue, and pastel purples utilised throughout.

Iconography, obtained from favicon, aligned images to the key text contained within relevant sections. This included an image of a cutlery set (corresponding with information on nutrition); a droplet image (corresponding with blood glucose testing and monitoring information); and an image of a dumbbell (corresponding with exercise information).

### Typography

Typography utilised were soft formated text styles including Open Sans and Roberto. This ensured the format of text retained the desired impact when compiled with relevant color schemes.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was utilised in the visualisation of the project during my inital concept stages, a three page Balsamiq wireframe was developed to support in obtaining a baseline overview of what it was intended I wished to obtain.

The idea evolved with time, notably with additions of video and maps to support the overall develppment of the project in line the project goals and user experience objectives.
